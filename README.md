# HUGE shoutout to sinbad and all the work he did
## the following cogs are his and his alone, however he has dropped support for them

### AntiMentionSpam

This cog provides automated actions against people spamming mentions.

Configuration is available via the `antimentionspam` command.


### BanSync

This cog provides a few functions for handling bans across multiple servers.

More help is available via `help BanSync`

### GuildJoinRestrict

Allows controlling and logging which guilds the bot can join based on configurable settings
and either an allowlist or blocklist.

Tip: If you do not want the bot taking these actions automatically,
or just want a log of guilds the bot has joined, set up a discord log channel,
use the allowlist mode with an empty allowlist, and do not turn on autoleaving.

### RoleManagement

Provides:

 - Reaction roles
 - Self roles
 - Purchasable roles
 - User list data based on roles
 - Mass Role modifications
 
Note: Roles self assigned via reaction or command are subject to
the settings configured in the `roleset` command.

This cog has some additional information documented [here](rolemanagement/README.md)
